# rusty_trader

A rust implementation of a trading bot based on the IBKR API (with rust ibapi) with fully automated executions and a frontend to track strategy performance
Check this [out](https://ryantyt.github.io/RTYT/journal/summer_trading_bot_3) for a more personal post on the building of this.

## Overview

This repository showcases the **public interface** of the trading system.  
The full implementation connects to **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)** via their API (with the help of rust ibapi), manages portfolio positions, executes trades, and supports research/backtesting.  

The goal of this repo is to showcase the:
- [**Backend architecture**](/trading-app/README.md) used for the strategies; the older Python implementation is left in for posterity.
- A separate [**Backend**](/backend/README.md) used for easy user interface built in rust as well.
- **Containerized development setup** with Docker for portability.
- The frontend architecture can be found [here](https://github.com/RyanTYT/rusty_trader_front).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **IBKR Integration**  
  - Connects to Interactive Brokers‚Äô Trader Workstation / IB Gateway.  
  - Handles positions, orders, and execution callbacks, updating the local DB accordingly.

- **Systematic Trading Interface**  
  - Unified API for positions, target allocations, transactions, and historical data.
  - Hybrid architecture: as far as rust is a hybrid between OOP and functional programming.

- **Containerized Setup**  
  - `docker-compose.yml` to run the trading-bot with IBKR Gateway in a GUI-enabled container (enabled with Xvfb).
  - Simple tests in the tests folder to test order management and bar consolidation.

## üìÇ Repo Structure

- IB: Builds the Docker Image to host the installed IB Gateway Instance
- backend: The backend to communicate with the local trading database and the frontend - for analytics and tracking of strategy performance
- postgres-data: To host the data of the timescaledb/postgresdb Database for persistence.
- trading-app: The rust trading application that is the main program to run the strategies on
- trading-app-old: The older Python implementation of the trading application for posterity (can be taken a look at for very blatant issues and problems with building such an application in Python - Loss of static typing, Bad event management system, 0 multithreading for strategies, ...)
